- This is a public HUD that can be used for non-EssentialsTF events. We kindly ask that you give credit in return whenever the hud is used in videos or live content.
- To get the most out of this HUD's features, install the latest [CastingEssentialsNext](https://github.com/drunderscore/CastingEssentialsNext/) by [DrUnderscore](https://github.com/drunderscore/).
   - A list of CastingEssentials commands used with this HUD can be found [here](https://github.com/CriticalFlaw/essentialsHUD/wiki/Common-Commands).
