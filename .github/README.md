### Notes
- List of common CE commands used with this HUD can be found [here](https://github.com/CriticalFlaw/essentialsHUD/wiki/Common-Commands).
- To use the included team scores panel, delete the `resource` folder from your installation of [CastingEssentials](https://github.com/dalegaard/CastingEssentials/releases). Not doing so will result in CE's own scores panel being used instead of the one made for this HUD.
